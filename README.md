# A-Python-Implementation-of-the-Babylonian-Method-for-Square-Root-Calculation
 this program uses the bisection method to approximate the square root of a given number. It prompts the user for input, checks for validity, and performs the bisection process until the root is sufficiently approximated. It then returns the square root to the user with an appropriate message.
